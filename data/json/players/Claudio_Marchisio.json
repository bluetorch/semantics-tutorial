A product of the Juventus youth system, he has spent his whole career thus far at his hometown club, with the exception of a season-long loan spell at Empoli. He is currently the club's second vice-captain, behind Giorgio Chiellini.Since making his breakthrough in the 2008–09 season, Marchisio has often been compared to former Juventus and Italy midfielder Marco Tardelli by the Italian press for his tenacious style of play and good reading of the game. A hard-tackling, versatile midfielder, he is able to play in defensive midfield or out wide but his preferred and most effective position is in the centre. Though predominantly right-footed, he is equally competent with his left, evidenced by his goals and his penchant for shooting from outside the penalty box if given the chance.", "comment":"Claudio Marchisio (Italian pronunciation: [ˈklaudjo marˈkizjo]; born 19 January 1986 in Turin) is an Italian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Juventus and the Italian national team.
