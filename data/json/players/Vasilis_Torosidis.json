Torosidis is known for his dynamic forward runs, accurate delivery from the flanks, and powerful shooting from distance, as well as his versatility as a full back, defensive midfielder and right winger.Vasilis Torosidis is a phenomenon of Greek football. He is hugely versatile and regularly plays in different positions both for his club and country. Boasting great energy, a willingness to get forward and strong heading ability, the Greek star is a manager's dream as he can fill in all over the park. Predominantly an attack-minded right-back, Torosidis has exclusively played on the left side of defence for the Greek national team. Although predominantly right-footed, he has a strong left peg and as a result can cover any position along the backline and in midfield. In midfield, his strongest position is as a defensive or central midfielder and he has also been used far higher up the pitch, when he was played behind the strikers.This versatility could be problematic for Torosidis in the coming years but thanks to his stubborn and fearless play he cannot be left out of the starting XI for either club or country.", "comment":"Vasilios \"Vasilis\" Torosidis (Greek: Βασίλης Τοροσίδης; born 10 June 1985) is a Greek footballer who currently plays for Italian Serie A club Roma and the Greek national team.
