It was formed in 1992, following the creation of Republka Srpska as a political entity. The Football Association of Republika Srpska (FS RS) was established on September 5, 1992 in spite of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina which had escalated earlier that year. The main task of FS RS in that period was to organize and manage competitions in the territory of Republika Srpska. The competitions were played in different league formats throughout the wartime.In 1995, the First League of Republika Srpska was established as a top division for clubs competition. Also a cup tournament was created, the Republika Srpska Cup. Meanwhile, separate leagues were formed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina which gathered Croatian and Bosniak clubs in the country. After the conflict ended, the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FSBiH, was created to represent all three organisations, was recognised by FIFA in 1996 and UEFA in 1998. As the Bosniak football federation was the only one to join, its clubs alone were allowed to compete internationally and contest the newly formed Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Faced with the fact that clubs from Republika Srpska hadn't been allowed to take part in international competitions, FS RS decided to join FSBiH, on May 23, 2002. After that, some top ranked clubs from the First League were promoted to the Premier League, which started on August 4 the same year." ;
