the pitch after a collision with Mats Hummels and was replaced by
Guinea-Bissau-born new boy Eder, just 21. It got worse for
Portugal, too, when just after the
hour-mark, Mats Hummels rose higher than anyone in the
penalty area to head home from a corner.
Things didn’t get much better in the second-half. Mid-way through
the period, creative midfielder Fabio Coentrao pulled up with a
hamstring injury and had to be carried off on a stretcher. It
looked the kind injury that won’t heal in short order. Not long
after, German defender and scorer Hummels was also helped off the
pitch after damaging his knee. It didn’t keep the Germans from
scoring again, however, and 12 minutes from time Muller completed
his hat-trick – the first of these finals – to make it 4-0.
